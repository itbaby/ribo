        "description": "Commissioned by a foreign asset management company, we efficiently completed the targeted dispatch of 120 IT engineers across the Asia-Pacific region within a 3-month cycle, achieving a 99% training pass rate. At the initial phase of the project, our team engaged deeply with the client to clarify specific job requirements in areas such as cloud computing, software development, and system maintenance across regional branches in the Asia-Pacific. We simultaneously formulated a three-dimensional screening standard covering technical capability, language proficiency, and cross-cultural collaboration, and precisely identified over 200 candidates from the global talent pool to enter the reserved pipeline. During the 4-week pre-employment training phase, we designed a customized curriculum based on the regional technical architecture features, including core modules such as microservices architecture practice, multi-language development environment adaptation, and regional data compliance standards, while introducing a real-time online assessment system for staged capability calibration."
